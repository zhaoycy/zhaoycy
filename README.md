## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lanbing, a data analyst with a background in macroeconomic analysis. <br>

After four years as an Economist at the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China and completing a data analysis bootcamp, I transitioned into a Junior Data Analyst role at Fortray Global Services Ltd. In this position, I have worked extensively with large datasets, developed interactive dashboards, and contributed to data-driven decision-making. My expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools such as Power BI and Tableau has enabled me to enhance reporting accuracy and streamline analytics processes.<br> 

My CV in [pdf](https://github.com/zhaoycy/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Lanbing%20Zhao%20-%20CV%20-%20Data%20Analyst.pdf).<br>

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science.<br>
